# AarogyaChain : Medical Health Records Management Using Blockchain


## Introduction
AarogyaChain is an innovative project that makes use of cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the management of medical health records. In this system, we harness the power of blockchain, Node.js, Web3.js, Ganache, IPFS, Metamask, and Truffle to create a robust and secure ecosystem for handling electronic health records (EHR).
AarogyaChain promises to enhance the security, accessibility, and efficiency of medical health records management, ultimately empowering healthcare providers and patients with a state-of-the-art solution for preserving and sharing critical health data.


## Tools

### Node.js
A runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript, widely used for building scalable and efficient web applications.

### Web3.js
A JavaScript library that provides interaction with Ethereum-based blockchains, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.

### Ganache
A personal blockchain for Ethereum development, designed to facilitate local testing and debugging of smart contracts without the need for a live network.

### IPFS
A peer-to-peer protocol and network for storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed and secure manner, ideal for decentralized data storage.

### Metamask
A browser extension that acts as a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to the Ethereum blockchain, simplifying interactions with dApps and blockchain networks.

### Truffle
A development framework and testing environment for Ethereum smart contracts, streamlining the process of creating, deploying, and managing blockchain applications.
